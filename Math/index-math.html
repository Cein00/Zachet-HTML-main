        <h3>Linear Equations</h3>
        <p>A linear equation is any equation that can be written in the form</p>
        <div class="formula-box">ax + b = 0</div>
        <p>where <span class="var">a</span> and <span class="var">b</span> are real numbers and <span class="var">x</span> is a variable. This form is sometimes called the standard form of a linear
equation. Note that most linear equations will not start off in this form. Also, the variable may or may not be an <span class="var">x</span>
so don't get too locked into always seeing an <span class="var">x</span> there.</p>

        <h3>Quadratic Equation</h3>
        <p>The standard form of a quadratic equation looks like this:</p>
        <div class="formula-box">ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0</div>
        <p>where <span class="var">a</span>, <span class="var">b</span>, <span class="var">c</span> are known values and <span class="var">x</span> is the variable o r unknown (we don't know it yet). Also, <span class="var">a</span> can 't be 0.</p>

        <h3>The area of a circle (A)</h3>
        <p><span class="var">&pi;</span> (Pi) times the radius (<span class="var">r</span>) squared:</p>
        <div class="formula-box">A = &pi; &times; r<sup>2</sup></div>

        <p>or, when you know the diameter (<span class="var">D</span>):</p>
        <div class="formula-box">A = (&pi; / 4) &times; D<sup>2</sup></div>

        <p>or, when you know the circumference (C):</p>
        <div class="formula-box">A = C<sup>2</sup>/ (4 &times; &pi;)</div>

        <h3>Intersection</h3>
        <p>The intersection of two sets <span class="var">A</span> and <span class="var">B</span>, denoted by A ⋂ B, is the set of all objects that are members of both the sets
A and B. In symbols,</p>
        <div class="formula-box">A ⋂ B = { x : x &isin; A and x &isin; B }</div>
        <p>That is, <span class="var">x</span> is an element of the intersection A ⋂ B if and only if x is both an element of <span class="var">A</span> and an element of <span class="var">B</span>.</p>
